# TDS-Project1
**Tools in Data Science course - Project 1**

- Used Python libraries ****requests**** (accessing GITHUB API) and ****pandas****(creating CSV files). I used the "Users Search", "User Details" and "Repositories" Github API endpoints.
- The most surprising fact that I found after analyzing the data are that there are 602 users in Berlin who have more than 200 followers on Github and among these, 509 have followers less than 1000.
- A suggestion to the developers is to always include a comprehensive README file in your repo. Also try to include steps of implementation and your code along with the results if you're comfortable and finally also take care of your code security by enabling push protection and taking other security steps.
