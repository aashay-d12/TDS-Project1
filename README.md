**Tools in Data Science course - Project 1**

- Used Python libraries ****requests**** (accessing GITHUB API) and ****pandas****(creating CSV files). I used the "Users Search", "User Details" and "Repositories" Github API endpoints.
- The most surprising facts that I found after analyzing the data are that there are only 30 users in Berlin who have more than 200 followers on Github and there is no user in Berlin who has less than 2443 and more than 200 followers.
- A suggestion to the developers is to always include a comprehensive README file in your repo. Also try to include steps of implementation and your code along with the results if you're comfortable and finally also take care of your code security by enabling push protection and taking other security steps.
